# Remote PC Control
I'm creating an application similar to UltraViewer in Python, but with less function (maybe I'll add more functions in the future). This project is used for widening my knowledge about network, socket and Python. I mean if you have a better idea for some functions, contact me, I'm always willing to take your advice.
This project is divided into two main folders: Client and Server. Because I don't know how to upload or create folder in Github, so I upload all of the files in this without any folder.
Server folder contains: 
  + server.py: Main processing file for server. If you use this app as a server user, run this file.
  + may be I'll add some other files in the future.
Client folder contains:
  + client.py: Main processing file for client. If you use this app as a client user, run this file.
  + pic.py: Main processing for screen capture function.
  + listApp.py: Main processing for functions that work with apps.
  + process.py: Main processing for functions that work with processes.
  + start.py: Starting a process.
  + startApp.py: Starting an app.
  + kill.py: Kill a process
  + keylog.py: Main processing for functions that do the work for keylogging.
